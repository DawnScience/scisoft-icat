		    In this tutorial we will look at running edna actors. These are a special kind of python actor running the edna &apos;plugins&apos;. If you were unable to run python in the last example, this tutorial will not work. Edna often runs underlying analysis codes which is where the true power of the system lies but also requires that these codes be installed and available.

      <description>
         Please take a look at edna-site now. Take the time to find out how to install and configure the underlying software which edna uses. If this workbench allows it, run the edna tests, otherwise run the tests using a python command.

      <description>
         In order to use edna actors in DAWB workflows you must set two environment variables before starting DAWB. The &quot;EDNA_HOME&quot; variable should be a path to a valid EDNA installation directory and &quot;EDNA_SITE&quot; should be set in order for EDNA to find the corresponding configuration files. If you haven&apos;t defined these two variables now please stop DAWB, define the two variables and restart DAWB.

         title="Getting to Grips with Edna Actors">
      <description>
         In the workbench there are many edna actors. However they all work the same way. They have the concept of an xml file as input and an xml as output. The input has a substitution done on it for inserting workbench values and the output has a extract called 'XPath' used which allows any part of the output file to be passed forwards as workflow variables.
      </description>
      <subitem
            label="1. Go to the thumbnail example and click on the edna actor there called 'Thumbnail Image'. Go to the attributes of the actor. Notice that there is a template XML file, containing expanded value and there is a output file which contains the xpath extracts which will be done.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="2. There is no need to change the path to these files, usually. Copying of actors when done, will share the same files.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="3. Now right click on the 'Thumbnail Image' and open the edna python file. Here you can see the edna 'plugin' python code which is running for the actor.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="4. Right click again on the actor and this time open the linker. This shows a multi-page editor containing a page for creating the input file and extracting from the output file.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="5. On the input page you will see a substitution editor as we used for spec macros earlier. The upstream variables are on the left and can be inserted to the XML file by selecting the text and double clicking the variable to replace. These will be expanded when the actor is run in the workflow.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="6. On the output page you will see xpath expressions written to extract information from the output file. In this case only the expression '/' is used which puts all of the XML into a variable called 'thumbnail_output'. To see example output files for helping with building your extract, open the python file again and click on 'Link with Editor' in the Project Explorer part. This will take you to the edna plugin area where example output XML files are located.">
      </subitem>
       <subitem
            label="7. Click on 'thumbnail_output' and then on 'Value' view. This shows the value of the xpath extract as you type it in based on an extract from an example output file. Change the value from '/' to '//thumbnailPath' and press enter. The value which the xpath extracts from the example output file changes. You can add many extracts from the XML information and pass these on to be used downstream.">

         title="Something More Complex">
      <description>
         Lets take a look at 'edna_characterisation.moml'. This workflow has multiple edna actors with variables which are propagated down the graph from the beginning.
      </description>
      <subitem
            label="1. Click on the connections from beginning to end to view the variables being passed down the workflow. Try and follow these down as best you can.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="2. Notice that there is an attribute for passing variables on, it is by default selected. Try de-selecting it and viewing the change in variables passed along the workflow pipeline.">

   <item title="Conclusion">
      <description>
         There are scores of edna plugins availble from EDNA. The usage of these in conjunction which Tango based data acquisition actors, will provide a single configurable interface to beamline control and data analysis.
      </description>
    <onCompletion>
      Congratulations, you can now run edna actors and complete advanced data analysis.
